  "aboutUsHint": "The NAKHLEX team is made up of a group of Iraqi university graduates who specialize in a variety of fields, including computer programming, management and economic. The team has been active in buying and selling digital currencies for the past few years. During these years, we have observed lack of a local bilingual platform that needs to be fit with the culture and language of Iraqi people. In addition, access to foreign digital exchanges, selling and buying unfairly by domestic exchanges also, lack of a secure and professional platform for trading digital currencies are other difficulties in this context. For the aforesaid reasons we decided to create a completely secure, fast and easy-to-use, bilingual and simple platform in buying and selling digital currencies specifically for Iraqi people.",

You are not allowed to sell, borrow, share or otherwise make available your account or any detail necessary to access your account to ANYONE other than yourself. You are responsible for maintaining adequate security and control of your username, password, authentication code or any other code or credential that you use to access the Services. You must not provide any misleading or fraudulent information, including, but not limited to having a non-personal phone number. Providing fake information for your account, faking your country of origin or providing fraudulent identification documents is prohibited and will lead to termination or suspension of your account and we reserve the right to take any legal action if we deem it fit and necessary.

Company accounts If you wish to use our Services as a legal entity, you are required to register an account in the name of that entity as the main account for that entity. When creating a company account, you confirm that you are duly authorized and have the legal capacity to execute this Agreement and that this Agreement is legally binding on such entity. After registration of the main company account, one or more other company sub-accounts may be registered for the same legal entity so that the company account and each sub-account is registered in the name of and operated by separate natural persons on behalf of the entity. The same legal entity may place several advertisements on our platform, created by different company account holders, but such advertisements may not be fully overlapping (e.g., using the same trade limits with the same price in the same payment method category in the same country). Identity Verification In order to ensure Nakhlex remains a safe platform for all of our users, and for us to comply with mandatory legal obligations which we are subjected to, we may require you to verify your identity to access the Services we offer. Identity verification may be required when you create advertisements, pass certain trade volume limits, during trade disputes, fraud investigations, and to ensure account ownership. As part of our ID verification process, we require you to provide us with your full name as well as documents and photographs that verify your identity and other details (e.g. valid passport). In certain situations (due to the regulatory or legal requirements) we may require enhanced identity verification. This may include requirements to verify details or sources of funds regarding payments you have made or received during trades on Nakhlex as well as transactions that you have sent or received from your account.\n\nYou may also request to delete your Personal Data, with exception that we may refuse your deletion request in certain circumstances, such as compliance with law or legal purposes. For data access, correction, or deletion requests, please contact support@nakhlex.com with the subject “DATA INQUIRY”. In response to data access, correction, or deletion request, we will verify the requesting party’s identity to ensure that he or she is legally entitled to make such request. While we aim to respond to these requests free of charge, we reserve the right to charge you a reasonable fee should your request be repetitive or onerous.",
  "6-trading": "6. TRADING",
  "6-tradingHint": "You can place one or more advertisements on our platform when you wish to offer to buy or sell Tether. We have the right to restrict the number of your advertisements for security reasons and reasons of suspected misconduct or fraudulent activity. Tether trades to either buy or sell Tethers are initiated by responding with a trade request to advertisements created by other users. With the trade request you are making a legally binding offer and agree to be bound by the terms and conditions of the trade (such as exchange rate, Tether amount and terms of payment) as determined by the advertiser to whom you are sending the trade request. When sending the trade request, you may need to select from options made available in the advertisements or accept any freeform terms and conditions set out by the advertiser in the terms of trade field and displayed on the advertisement page. The terms and conditions of the trade must be in accordance with the terms of this Agreement. In case of discrepancy, the terms of this Agreement shall prevail. When you are selling Tether, it is your responsibility to check that you have received payment for the full amount, that the payment is not made by a third party to the trade without that party’s authorization, and that it was made according to your instructions given to the buyer. After you have released a trade to the buyer it is not possible to cancel, reverse, dispute or otherwise recover or return the Tethers to you. Payments made by buyers must be sent by the same person or entity who is the holder of the account or the company account unless authorized in writing by the payer. Receiving, making, providing, or attempting to receive, make or  provide  payments to or  from third  parties  is  forbidden  and considered a violation of this Agreement unless authorized by the third party. All communication relevant to the trade must happen in the trade chat on our platform in such a way that it is readily available for Nakhlex support staff to review. Consequently, communications on our platform are not considered private communications  between you and other users, but Nakhlex is also a party to such communications, and may access and otherwise process such communications in accordance with the Privacy Policy. Communication that has not occurred on our platform or that has been hidden, encrypted or otherwise obstructed from view is not taken into consideration during dispute review and dispute resolution.",
  "7-P2P": "7. P2P DISPUTE SETTLEMENT",
  "7-P2PHint": "When a buyer and a seller are in disagreement over a trade, either party or Nakhlex can start a dispute to initiate a mediation process on the Tether held in escrow. Disputed trades are reviewed and resolved by Nakhlex. Disputes can only be started on trades that are open and marked as paid by the buyer but not yet released by the seller. Trades that are not marked as paid by the buyer, have been released by the seller, or already disputed and resolved are considered completed and cannot be disputed, reversed, or altered. Nakhlex support has the right to re-open trades when the payment has been made but the trade has been cancelled. Nakhlex does not become a guarantor of any party’s performance of a trade. Therefore, although Nakhlex helps in resolving disputes, you assume the risk that any party with whom you trade (counterparty) may fail to perform in accordance with your agreement with the counterparty. By using Nakhlex’ Services, you release Nakhlex, indemnify and hold it harmless from any liability arising out of or related to a counterparty’s failure to perform as agreed.",
  "8-advertisements": "8. ADVERTISEMENTS",
  "8-advertisementsHint": "You can create a trade advertisement to advertise that you want to buy or sell   Tether.   Other   users   can   send   trade   requests   to   you   from   the advertisements that you’ve created. When a trade request is sent to you a Tether trade is automatically started. When you have advertisements enabled you are required to be active and available to reply to trades started from these advertisements. If a dispute is initiated in a trade against an advertiser who is not active and available, the advertiser   may   be   deemed   unresponsive   within   the   meaning   of   this Agreement and the dispute may be resolved against them. Information and payment details you provide in advertisements and trades must at all times be correct and up to date. Disputes may be resolved against   you   if   you   include   out-of-date   payment   details   and   a   buyer completes payment accordingly. Refusal to complete trades or to provide payment details for trades opened from your advertisements is considered a violation of this Agreement. The price or price equation that is defined in the advertisement details must contain any and all fees that the advertiser requires the buyer to pay. After initiation of a trade the price is locked and cannot be changed. Multiple advertisements which are fully overlapping (e.g. using the same trade limits with the same price in the same payment method category in the same country) are not allowed.",
  "9-limitation": "9. LIMITATION, SUSPENSION, AND TERMINATION OF YOUR USER ACCOUNT",
  "9-limitationHint": "Occasionally situations arise where we may need to limit, suspend, or terminate   your   account.   Account   limitation   results   in   a   temporary   or permanent loss of access to a certain specific part or parts of our Services. Account suspension results in a temporary loss of access to most or all parts of our Services. Account termination results in permanent loss of access to all Services. As a result of limitation, suspension or termination your access to and the withdrawal of cryptocurrencies that you have in your Nakhlex wallet may be delayed or denied.

We have the right to limit, suspend, or terminate your account or access to our Services in any of the following scenarios: 1. we have a reason to believe that You have acted in violation of these Terms or applicable laws or regulations or if we have a reason to believe that any content or material submitted or shared by You in or through the Services violates these Terms or applicable laws or regulations or third-party rights; 2. we suspect that You use the Services to engage in, attempt to engage in,   or   in   connection   with   fraudulent   activity,   money   laundering, terrorist financing or other financial crime; 3. we have not been able to verify your identity or we have reason to believe   that   you   have   supplied   false,   misleading   or   deceptive information in connection with your registration, identity verification, trades or any other use of our Services, either to us or to another user; 4. we are required to do so under any applicable law, regulation or an order issued by an authority or court; 5.

You attempt any unauthorized access to user accounts or any part or component of the Services. We will give You a notice of any limitation, suspension, or termination of your account but we may, if it is reasonable to do so (for example we consider it advisable for security reasons), limit, suspend or terminate your account without prior notice to you. You acknowledge that our decision to limit, suspend, or terminate your account, may be based on confidential criteria that are essential to our risk management and security protocols and that we are under no obligation to disclose the details of our risk management and security procedures to You unless otherwise provided. In the event that we limit or suspend your account we will lift the limitation or suspension as soon as possible once the reasons for such limitation or suspension no longer exist.",

Unless otherwise specified, you accept that fees are automatically deducted from your Nakhlex wallet balance or deposit at the time when the service is rendered or completed. We reserve the right to change the fees or the principles of pricing from time to time in accordance with the terms of this Agreement. If   we   decide   to   support   a   new   cryptocurrency,   unless   otherwise communicated by us, this Agreement, including any reference to current ones, shall be equally applied to the new cryptocurrency.",

  "11-terminationHint": "Although we are not contemplating doing it, we have the right to cease the Services altogether and unilaterally terminate this Agreement in case our business is terminated for whatever reason or if the business is transferred, sold to or merged with a third party, or for any other cause or reason deemed fit in our discretion.
